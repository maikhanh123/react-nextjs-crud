# PROBLEM

Clip-06 is really two separate clips and entityHooks folder should be entityMethods.  Not sure what went wrong going to M6 from M5 but need to make Sure end of M6 is really start of M6

In the videos, I have clip-060 and clip-070 in M5.  Both of these refer to /hooks/entityHooks, but somehow the source I have for clip-06-1-to-1-react-ui-final-PROBLEM-ENTITYHOOKS-VS-ENTITYMETHODS uses /hooks/entityMethods

No idea where the source went for the original recordings, but those recordings need to be fixed as M6 starts out just like clip-06-1-to-1-react-ui-final-PROBLEM-ENTITYHOOKS-VS-ENTITYMETHODS does
